        <h1><strong>Bio</strong></h1>
        <p>After graduating with my bachelors degree from Longwood University and then working in the mortgage industry
           for 4 years, I have decided my next endeavor is to learn how to code. I have experience working in a fast paced
           environment where our client is our top priority. I also have experience being a licensed educator and served as
           a peer coach for many of my teammates. I am constantly working towards becoming a better version of myself and by 
           challenging myself to learn how to code is the next step on my journey.
